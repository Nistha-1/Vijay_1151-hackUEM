Introduction
This project is a Staking Application built using the Move language. The application allows users to stake their tokens in exchange for rewards. The primary features include staking, unstaking, and calculating rewards based on the amount staked and the duration of the stake.

Features
Stake Tokens: Users can stake their tokens into the staking contract.
Unstake Tokens: Users can unstake their tokens, either partially or fully.
Rewards Calculation: The application calculates rewards based on the staked amount and the time duration the tokens were staked.
Claim Rewards: Users can claim their accumulated rewards after unstaking.
Prerequisites
Move Language: The smart contracts for this staking application are written in Move, so you need to have the Move compiler installed.
Move Package Manager (MPM): Used for managing Move packages and dependencies.
Testnet/Devnet Account: An account on a Move-compatible blockchain network for deploying and interacting with the contracts.
